# The Cats@Night Linux Playbook

This website contains various tips, tricks and recommendations on using the different operating systems that [build upon the Linux kernel](https://devrant.com/rants/1051771/id-just-like-to-interject-for-a-moment-what-you-re-referring-to-as-linux-is-in-f).

The scope of this website will be to provide general information on common Linux concepts and paradigms to specific information on endorsed packages and their configuration. You'll also find instructions on installation or set-up of certain distributions or packages in ways that I recommend.


As things currently stand, this website is a very early draft and will be subject to extensive changes, removals and additions.
